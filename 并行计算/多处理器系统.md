Most systems use a single general-purpose processor
-   ﻿﻿Most systems have special-purpose processors as well

**Multiprocessors** systems growing in use and importance
	-  ﻿﻿Also known as **parallel systems, tightly-coupled systems**
	-  Advantages include:
		1.  ﻿﻿﻿Increased throughput
		2.  ﻿﻿﻿Economy of scale
		3.  ﻿﻿﻿Increased reliability - graceful degradation or fault tolerance
	- Two types:
		1.  ﻿﻿﻿**Asymmetric Multiprocessing对称多处理器**：each processor is assigned a specie task.
		2.  ﻿﻿﻿**Symmetric Multiprocessing不对称多处理** each processor performs all tasks，每个处理器的性能都一样
